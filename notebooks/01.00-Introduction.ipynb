    "A computer program is a set of instructions that causes a computer to perform some kind of action. It isn’t the physical parts of a computer—like the wires, micro- chips, cards, hard drive, and such—but the hidden stuff running on that hardware. A computer program, which I’ll usually refer to as just a program, is the set of commands that tell that dumb hardware what to do. Software is a collection of computer programs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Without computer programs, almost every device you use daily would either stop working or be much less useful than it is now. Computer programs, in one form or another, control not only your personal com- puter but also video game systems, cell phones, and the GPS units in cars. Software also controls less obvi- ous items like LCD TVs and their remote controllers, as well as some of the newest radios, DVD players, ovens, and some fridges. Even car engines, traffic lights, street lamps, train signals, electronic billboards, and elevators are controlled by programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs are a bit like thoughts. If you didn’t have thoughts, you would probably just sit on the floor, staring vacantly and drooling down the front of your shirt. Your thought “get up off the floor” is an instruction, or command, that tells your body to stand up. In the same way, computer programs tell computers what to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you know how to write computer programs, you can do all sorts of useful things. Sure, you may not be able to write programs to control cars, traffic lights, or your fridge (well, at least not at first), but you could create web pages, write your own games, or even make a program to help with your homework.\n"
